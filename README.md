In this project, we've created an Interface with various visualization tools to accomplish VAST Challenge 2024 MC-2 tasks with my colleagues. Our goal was to detect the behavior of different types of vessels and find illegal fishing activities like SouthSeafood Express Corp. In the interface, we've used 5 graphs to show the behaviors of vessels. 
These graphs:
- Heatmap
- Line Chart
- Pixel Graph
- 2 Network Graph
